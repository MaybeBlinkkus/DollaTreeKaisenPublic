I got permission from Nevilisco to turn their resource packs into a mod since they wanted to do so but don't know how at the moment, all sprite credits go 100% entirely towards them and not me. 

You may find the original texture pack here by Nevilisco Shard here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3286355648
